# REST-API

These apis were made by me when I was working as an Intern for the Biztime IT solutions Pvt. Ltd. during the year 2020 for a period of 1 month.
The purpose of these apis is to send information whenever a get/post request is sent to the respective path.

These apis are written in Node.js.
